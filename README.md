# FrockBot

FrockBot is an experimental Cordis-first desktop environment for persistent conversational bots. Host, agent, and WebUI capabilities are composed as plugins across explicit Electron process seams.

The current vertical slice includes:

- an Electron main-process Cordis root and authenticated loopback WebUI host;
- a sandboxed Cordis WebUI/Vue renderer composed as a client plugin;
- a separate Cordis utility process with an event-sourced custom agent loop;
- streamed text, journaled tool calls, cancellation, restart, and lifecycle cleanup;
- an executable Cordis loader, dependency, isolation, WebSocket, CSP, and Electron foundation proof.

See [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) and [`docs/adr/0001-cordis-application-spine.md`](docs/adr/0001-cordis-application-spine.md).

## Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.3 or newer

## Development

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

The deterministic foundation provider runs without credentials. To use an OpenAI-compatible endpoint:

```bash
FROCKBOT_LLM_BASE_URL="https://api.example.com/v1" \
FROCKBOT_LLM_MODEL="model-id" \
FROCKBOT_LLM_API_KEY="..." \
  bun run dev
```

`FROCKBOT_LLM_API_KEY` is optional for local endpoints. `FROCKBOT_LLM_PROVIDER_ID` customizes the provider label.

Electron's installer script is explicitly allowed through the root `trustedDependencies` setting. If Electron was installed before that setting existed, rebuild its binary once:

```bash
node apps/desktop/node_modules/electron/install.js
```

## Checks

```bash
bun run typecheck
bun test
bun run build
bun run proof:cordis
```

The desktop smoke path can capture the connected UI without a model call:

```bash
FROCKBOT_SMOKE_SCREENSHOT="$PWD/artifacts/frockbot.png" \
  bun run --filter @frockbot/desktop start
```

To exercise one streamed custom-loop turn and its WebUI projection:

```bash
FROCKBOT_SMOKE_SCREENSHOT="$PWD/artifacts/frockbot-chat.png" \
FROCKBOT_SMOKE_PROMPT='/echo FrockBot is ready.' \
  bun run --filter @frockbot/desktop start
```

## Security model

Renderers use `nodeIntegration: false`, context isolation, Chromium sandboxing, authenticated loopback transport, origin checks, and restrictive content security policy. Agent execution runs in an Electron utility process.

Cordis contexts provide composition and lifecycle ownership, not security isolation. Generated or unreviewed executable plugins must run inside a restricted process, container, or micro-VM rather than Electron main; untrusted rich UI must run in a sandboxed frame rather than the trusted WebUI context.

## Current limitations

- model configuration currently uses environment variables rather than onboarding UI;
- sessions are currently in memory;
- the computer and routines panel is presentational;
- the manifest-driven package catalog works for built-in packages, but external package discovery and download are not implemented;
- application packaging and code signing are not configured.
